A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System

              Humans can visually sense the world around them by using their sensory organs and brain. Computer vision works on enabling computers 
to see and process images in the same way that human vision does. Several algorithms developed in the area of computer vision to recognize images. 
The goal of this work is to create a modle to identify and determine the handwritten digits from its datasets with better accuracy and aim to complete 
this by using the concept of Convolutional Network and MNIST dataset. A method called Soft Max Regression is used for assigning the probabilities to 
handwritten digits. Though the goal is to create a modle which can recognize digits but can extend for letters and then a person's handwriting.Through
 this work,people can learn and practically apply the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks.
